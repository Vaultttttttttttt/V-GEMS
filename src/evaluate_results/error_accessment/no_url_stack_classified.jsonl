The prediction lists 16 specific units and explicitly states \"共16个学院\" (a total of 16 colleges). However, the reference answer clearly indicates 17 colleges. Although the listed entities in the prediction match most of those in the reference, the count is incorrect—16 vs. the correct 17. This discrepancy in the numerical answer makes the prediction factually inaccurate. Even if one considers \"艺术与设计系\" as a department rather than a college, the reference answer still counts it as part of the 17 and includes \"等\", suggesting additional colleges beyond the listed ones. Therefore, the prediction undercounts and provides an incorrect total, which directly affects the correctness of the answer to the question.", "distribution": "Hallucination"}

Since the question asks specifically for the research centers mentioned on the website (implying a factual check against the reference), and the prediction provides a different set of centers not found in the reference, this part of the answer is incorrect.
